#summary Development notes.

= General Notes =
  * There are some duplicate docIDs in GOV2, and their scores will be the same; manually verified for a few docs.

= Experiments to Run =
  * Benchmark indexing speed and query speed against zettair. Can also index with varbyte to make comparison fair.
  * To test decompression speeds, can use the loop over list function. This would ignore scoring function and other overheads.

= Files That Need Serious Cleanup =
  * document_map.h/cc
  * query_processor.h/cc

= Commands to Keep in Mind =
  * valgrind --tool=cachegrind --branch-sim=yes --cachegrind-out-file=cachegrind.out ./irtk --loop-over-index-data=gov  index.idx index.lex index.dmap index.meta
